# Cresco Documentation

# 📖 &nbsp; [**Read the docs → crescoedge.github.io/quickstart**](https://crescoedge.github.io/quickstart/)

The **canonical documentation** for [Cresco](https://github.com/CrescoEdge) — a hierarchical, secure,
multi-tenant distributed agent mesh — is published as a full site at
**<https://crescoedge.github.io/quickstart/>**. This repository holds its source.

**All project information lives there:** architecture, every module/plugin, every callable action, both
client libraries, configuration, operations, and the engineering design documents.

## Contributing

Keep pages accurate to the source. When a subsystem changes, update its architecture page and, where
relevant, the design document under `docs/design/`. New features should be documented as flag-gated and
default-off, matching the codebase's convention.
