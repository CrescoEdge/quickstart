# Cresco Documentation Site

The canonical documentation for [Cresco](https://github.com/CrescoEdge) — a hierarchical, secure,
multi-tenant distributed agent mesh. Built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) +
[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

**All project information lives here:** architecture, every module/plugin, every callable action, both
client libraries, configuration, operations, and the engineering design documents.

## Build & serve

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install mkdocs-material

mkdocs serve      # live-reload dev server at http://127.0.0.1:8000
mkdocs build      # render static HTML into ./site
```

Navigation and theme are defined in [`mkdocs.yml`](mkdocs.yml).

## Contributing

Keep pages accurate to the source. When a subsystem changes, update its architecture page and, where
relevant, the design document under `docs/design/`. New features should be documented as flag-gated and
default-off, matching the codebase's convention.
