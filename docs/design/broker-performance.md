# Cresco — Broker & Data-Plane Performance (v1.3)

**Scope:** every performance change made to the Cresco message broker and data paths on the
`felix-hygiene` line, with the measured effect and the config lever that controls it. All levers are
`-D`-overridable (the `Config` System-property fallthrough), defaults preserve shipped behavior.

> Companion: **`docs/distributed-identity-trust-design.md`** (security / tenant isolation). Security
> enforcement (`broker_security_enabled`) is orthogonal to every performance lever here and, when off
> (default), has zero effect on these paths.

## 1. ActiveMQ 6.2.7 upgrade
- **What:** embedded ActiveMQ Classic **6.1.4 → 6.2.7** (`controller/pom.xml` `activemq.version`). Only the
  4 activemq jars change in the transitive tree (broker/client/kahadb/openwire-legacy); no other churn.
- **Why:** current release; hardens the CVE-2023-46604 OpenWire deserialization vector. Needs Java 17+ (JDK 21 ok).
- **Cresco-specific notes:** 6.2.x removed `java.lang` from default trusted serializable packages — N/A to
  the core path (MsgEvent is **Gson JSON `TextMessage`**, not `ObjectMessage`). If a plugin ever sends+receives
  data-plane `ObjectMessage`, set `activeMQSslConnectionFactory.setTrustedPackages(...)`. **Do not** move the
  core MsgEvent path to `ObjectMessage` (RCE surface, version-brittle, breaks the Python client, not faster).

## 2. Broker throughput levers (all `-D`-configurable)
Added to `ActiveBroker.java`; defaults preserve behavior.
- `activemq_socket_buffer_size` (**2MB**, was ~64KB default): broker-side accept-socket buffers. The client
  already set large buffers; the broker acceptor did not → the single biggest inter-node throughput lever.
  **2.1×–6.1×** and kills 40–48% data-plane loss across the TCP bridge.
- `activemq_max_frame_size` (**128MB**): wire-format max frame so large binary blocks aren't rejected/split.
- `activemq_journal_disk_syncs` (**false**): KahaDB fsync-per-write off. Cresco uses persistence as a
  **flow-control** mechanism, not for crash durability — so removing the per-write fsync latency (the
  persistent-bulk bottleneck) is free for the stated intent. **~60×/~21×** on persistent bulk.
- `activemq_use_cache` (**false**, by design): the dispatch cache is a store-dispatch optimization that A/B
  showed buys **nothing** on Cresco's in-JVM `vm://` / non-persistent paths (≈360 MB/s either way). Kept off.
- `activemq_dedicated_task_runner` (**false**): pooled task runner instead of thread-per-destination →
  scales to large agent counts without thread blowup.
- System usage ceilings: `broker_memory_limit` (default = max(512MB, ½ heap)), `broker_store_limit` (8GB),
  `broker_temp_limit` (4GB). The old fixed 256MB non-persistent ceiling collapsed aggregate throughput
  (~16 MB/s at 4×256KB streams vs ~470 with headroom) via the pending-message eviction throttle.
- Also configurable: `activemq_producer_flow_control` (false), `activemq_prioritized_messages` (true),
  `activemq_destination_memory_limit`, `activemq_gc_inactive_destinations`, `activemq_inactive_timeout_before_gc`,
  `activemq_persistent`, `activemq_destination_purge_period`.

**Backpressure vs speed — the critical distinction:** buffers and fsync are **speed** knobs, not backpressure.
Backpressure comes from `producerFlowControl` / prefetch / system-usage. Fast-producer/slow-consumer test:
flow-control ON throttled the producer ~4× and blocked; OFF ran ahead with a memory-bounded (~36%) backlog, no
crash. The old small-buffer+fsync combo was only *accidental* backpressure. Cresco runs flow-control **off** and
lets **priority QoS** govern dispatch (§3), with non-persistent eviction bounding telemetry memory.

## 3. Control-plane priority QoS (agent-liveness never starved)
- **Problem:** under bulk+telemetry load the non-persistent liveness ping (shared flow-controlled producer)
  was evicted/blocked → a single 5s miss → `globalControllerLost` → agent/region dropped.
- **Fix (controller `f157677`):** `MsgQoS` classifier → tiers **LIVENESS (pri 9, persistent) > CONTROL (pri 7,
  persistent) > TELEMETRY (pri 4, non-persistent) > BULK (pri 1)**; liveness+control on a **separate producer/
  session** from telemetry so floods can't serialize/evict/block the ping; flow-control off (priority governs
  dispatch); N-consecutive-miss + retry + jitter before declaring loss.
- **Proof (StarvationRepro, real broker, flood):** ping send-call **p50 503ms / p99 6041ms → p50 7.6ms / max 15ms**,
  8 → 58 pings delivered in 15s, **zero starvation**.
- Levers: `region_ping_retries`, `region_ping_max_failures`, `controlplane_ttl`, `agentproducer_data_threads`,
  `agentproducer_data_queue`.

## 4. Data-plane sharding + parallel bridges
- **Sharding** (`DataPlaneServiceImpl`): split `global.event` into N shard topics (`dataplane_shards`,
  `dataplane_shard_topic`); a stream hashes to a shard; each shard gets a **dedicated broker connection**
  (`ActiveClient.createDedicatedSession`) instead of multiplexing everything over one socket (the agent→region
  throughput funnel). Result: 800 flat → **1,150** scaling, 0 loss.
- **Parallel bridge connectors** (`ActiveBroker.AddNetworkConnector`): the region↔global bridge is
  destination-partitioned so connector *i* forwards exactly shard *i* over its **own TLS socket/core** —
  removing the single-duplex-connector single-core cliff. Runtime-adjustable
  (`addBridgeConnections`/`removeBridgeConnections`, `broker_bridge_connections`).

## 5. Native TLS acceleration
- **wss paths (wsapi server + Java clientlib):** `netty-tcnative-boringssl-static` (Netty `SslProvider.OPENSSL`).
  Applying it to **both** ends (the Java client's JSSE crypto was the bottleneck; Python already used OpenSSL)
  gave **2.1× single-stream (289 → 604 MB/s)** and **4,380 MB/s aggregate**.
- **Broker bridge (JSSE `nio+ssl`):** **Conscrypt** JCE provider (BoringSSL) installed for the ActiveMQ TLS
  bridge → **+15–40% cross-node**. (`conscrypt-openjdk-uber` 2.6-alpha5, first with osx/linux aarch_64 natives.)

## 6. Jetty 12 data-plane (correctness + throughput)
- **Correctness:** the jakarta **partial** upload handler under Jetty 12 delivered ~8KB chunks as separate
  BytesMessages (256KB → ~8 broker messages). Fixed to a **whole-message** handler → 1000/1000 byte-exact.
- **Throughput killer — permessage-deflate:** Python `websockets` requests it by default; Jetty 12 negotiated it
  → every binary block deflate-compressed on both ends (pointless, CPU-bound), capping Python 256KB at ~217 MB/s.
  **Disabled in 3 places** (server extension unregister, python `compression=None`, Java client unregister) →
  Python **217 → 444–474 MB/s**, beating the old 434.
- **Jetty 12.0.17 → 12.1.10:** the `setInputBufferSize` corruption was a 12.0.x bug fixed in 12.1; on 12.1.10 the
  256KB input buffer sticks byte-exact → Java receiver keeps up with a fast sender, **no best-effort loss**, and
  sustained 256KB is **Java 366 ≈ Python 362 MB/s**, both 20000/20000 byte-exact. (Server AND client must be
  the same Jetty version.) Other tuning: I/O buffers 4KB→256KB, maxFrameSize→16MB, TCP socket buffers 4MB,
  direct TLS buffers, blocking `getBasicRemote()` send for backpressure.

## 7. stunnel
- **Root cause:** 8KB re-chunking on egress. **Fix:** single-buffer write (`Unpooled.wrappedBuffer`) +
  configurable read allocator + socket buffers + live `nettuning`. Result: **~9× (250 → 2,200 steady,
  3,110 at 1GB)**. (`getTunnelStatus` also now reports real ACTIVE/RECOVERING/DOWN — see B13.)

## 8. Why the single-node client suite looked "flat"
The client-facing speed suite (`run/tests/results-history/`) is **flat** across v1.2/phase0/2/3 because those
were OSGi-correctness commits, and because the single-node paths are **in-JVM `vm://` and/or non-persistent** —
they never touch the TCP bridge socket buffers or the KahaDB journal, which is exactly where the big wins live.
Two same-host A/Bs prove the flatness is environmental, not regression: `useCache` true≈false, and ActiveMQ
6.1.4≈6.2.7 (holding tuning constant). The tuning's real target — **persistent multi-node bulk over the bridge**
— is measured by `run/tests/dataplane_internode.py` and `run/tests/java/BrokerBulkPerf.java`, which show the
2.1–6.1× (socket buffers) and ~60× (disk-syncs) wins directly.

## 9. Reproduce
- Internode bridge: `run/tests/dataplane_internode.py` (agent-001 with own wsapi; sender→global, receiver→agent → demand-forwarded over the bridge).
- Broker-direct persistent bulk: `run/tests/java/BrokerBulkPerf.java` against a plaintext connector
  (`-Dactivemq_transport=nio -Denable_dynamic_broker_port=false`, `tcp://localhost:32010`).
- Broker-bench micro: `broker-bench/` (`TuningBench` proved persistent 256KB 22 → 1167 MB/s, 52×).
- Client suite: `run/tests/run_speedtests.sh <label>` → `results-history/<label>.md`.
