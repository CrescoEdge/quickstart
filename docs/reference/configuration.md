# Configuration Parameters

This is the exhaustive reference for Cresco node configuration parameters. Every parameter
listed here corresponds to a typed getter call (`getStringParam`, `getIntegerParam`,
`getLongParam`, `getBooleanParam`, `getDoubleParam`) in the source tree, grouped by concern.

## How configuration works

A Cresco node is configured through a `Config` helper that exposes **typed getters**. Each
getter takes a parameter name and (usually) a default value, e.g.
`getIntegerParam("broker_port", 32010)`. The resolution order is:

1. **`-D<name>=<value>` JVM system properties** passed on the launch command line.
2. **Config-file / plugin-config values** loaded into the node's config map (the same map
   that `getConfigMap()` persists to the controller DB).
3. **The default baked into the getter call** — used when neither of the above supplies a value.

Because every getter ships with a default, **an unconfigured node runs with sane, shipped
behavior**; you only set the parameters you want to change. Most feature-gates are
**default-off** (e.g. `broker_security_enabled=false`, `net_autotune=false`,
`tenant_namespacing=false`, `enable_udp_discovery=false`), so enabling a capability is an
explicit, opt-in decision. A handful of getters have **no default** (see the *Unset =
disabled* note on each such row); when unset they return `null` and the corresponding feature
is skipped.

!!! example "Setting parameters on the command line"
    ```bash
    java -Dis_region=true \
         -Dregionname=east \
         -Dbroker_security_enabled=true \
         -Dtenant_namespacing=true \
         -jar cresco-agent-*.jar
    ```

!!! warning "Types are enforced at read time"
    A few parameters are read with `getStringParam` even though they hold a numeric or
    boolean value (e.g. `failover_reconnect_delay`, `max_reconnect_attempts`,
    `use_exponential_backOff`, `wsapi_port`). Supply them as plain strings; they are parsed
    downstream. These are flagged in the tables below.

Unless noted, byte-size defaults shown as expressions (e.g. `2 * 1024 * 1024`) are given in
their evaluated form (`2 MB`). Where a default is **computed at runtime**, the table says so
explicitly.

---

## Security & tenancy (read this first)

These flags govern who can connect to the broker, whose identity is asserted, and how tenants
are isolated. **All of them are default-off**, so a stock node behaves exactly as it always
has — enabling them is a deliberate hardening/tenancy decision. Enable them consistently
across a region; a mixed fleet (some nodes enforcing, some not) will not behave as intended.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `broker_security_enabled` | boolean | `false` | Master switch for broker authentication/authorization. When on, external (non-`vm://`) clients must assert an identity (JMS username `tenant\|region\|agent`, or a cert subject under mutual TLS) and are checked against the tenant policy; when off the ACL plugin is never installed and the broker behaves as before. |
| `broker_require_client_auth` | boolean | `false` | Require mutual TLS (client certificate) on the broker transport connector. When on, clients without a trusted certificate are rejected at the TLS layer. |
| `broker_security_secret` | String | `cresco` | Shared password the local controller and clients present as the JMS password when `broker_security_enabled` is on. Change this from the default in any secured deployment. |
| `broker_superuser_tenants` | String | `cresco-system` | Comma-separated list of tenant IDs whose **network** clients are granted the cross-tenant SUPERUSER ("god view") role — e.g. a fabric-admin dashboard that must see every tenant. The local `vm://` controller and broker bridges are already exempt. |
| `broker_shared_destinations` | String | `agent.event,region.event,global.event` | Comma-separated destination prefixes treated as fabric-shared control destinations that all tenants may use (the control-plane event topics). |
| `broker_security_log_allow` | boolean | `false` | Log *allowed* (not just denied) authorization decisions in the broker ACL plugin — verbose; for debugging tenant policy only. |
| `security_regional_ca` | boolean | `false` | Enable Regional-CA identity mode ("Option C"): during discovery the region acts as issuing authority and signs each joining node a region-signed leaf certificate, and joiners present that identity. When off, the legacy self-signed discovery exchange is used. |
| `tenant_namespacing` | boolean | `false` | Namespace broker destinations, dataplane topics, and producer routing per tenant so that tenants are isolated on shared topics. Off = the historical single flat namespace. |
| `tenant_id` | String | `default` | The tenant this node belongs to; used to build the asserted broker identity, tenant-namespaced destinations, and the node's certificate subject. |
| `discovery_secret_agent` | String | random UUID | Shared secret validating **agent**-level discovery messages. Computed default is a random UUID per boot, so peers must be given a matching explicit value to discover each other. |
| `discovery_secret_region` | String | random UUID | Shared secret validating **region**-level discovery messages (region joining/forming). Random UUID by default — set explicitly across the region. |
| `discovery_secret_global` | String | random UUID | Shared secret validating **global**-level discovery messages (region-to-global join). Random UUID by default — set explicitly across the mesh. |

!!! danger "The discovery secrets default to random UUIDs"
    Because `discovery_secret_agent/region/global` default to a fresh UUID on every boot, two
    nodes will **not** discover one another unless you set the same secret on both. In a real
    deployment these are effectively required, not optional.

---

## Identity & roles

Determines what a node *is* in the hierarchy (agent / region / global / standalone) and how it
names itself. Exactly one role flag is normally set; the state machine reads them to decide the
boot path.

|---|---|---|---|
| `is_agent` | boolean | `false` | Boot as an **agent** that reports to a regional controller. |
| `is_region` | boolean | `false` | Boot as a **regional controller** that hosts agents (and may connect to a global). |
| `is_global` | boolean | `false` | Boot as a **global controller** that manages regions. |
| `is_standalone` | boolean | `false` | Boot as a self-contained node with no parent controller. |
| `agentname` | String | *unset* | Explicit name for this agent/controller instance. **Unset = auto-generated.** |
| `regionname` | String | *unset* | Explicit name for this node's region. **Unset = auto-generated.** |
| `ipv6` / `isIPv6` | boolean | `false` | Prefer IPv6 for this node's networking/discovery (`ipv6` is read in the library `PluginBuilder`; `isIPv6` in the controller engine). Off = IPv4. |
| `pluginID` | String | *unset* | Identifier of the running plugin (set by the framework per loaded plugin, not a node-wide knob). |
| `pluginname` | String | *unset* | Human name of the running plugin (framework-supplied per plugin). |

---

## Static plugins (feature enable flags)

| `enable_stunnel` | boolean | `true` | Load the **stunnel** plugin (secure TCP tunneling over the fabric). |
| `enable_wsapi` | boolean | `true`¹ | Load the **wsapi** plugin (WebSocket API gateway). ¹Default is `true` in the static loader; a separate call in the wsapi plugin uses `false` as its own guard. |
| `enable_repo` | boolean | `false`¹ | Load the **repo** plugin (plugin/jar repository). ¹Read in two places with differing defaults (`false` in one, `true` in another); set explicitly if you rely on it. |
| `enable_controllermon` | boolean | `true` | Enable the controller performance monitor (`PerfControllerMonitor`). |
| `enable_console` | boolean | `false` | Attach the interactive Felix/host console on startup (host application). |
| `enable_perf` | boolean | `false` | Enable the sysinfo continuous performance sampler. |
| `plugin_config_file` | String | `conf/plugins.ini` | Path to the static plugin definition file the loader reads. |

| `activemq_dedicated_task_runner` | boolean | `false` | Use a dedicated thread per broker task instead of a shared pool. |
| `activemq_journal_disk_syncs` | boolean | `false` | Force `fsync` on each KahaDB journal write. Off trades durability-on-crash for I/O throughput. |

| `broker_bridge_prefetch` | int | `100` | Prefetch limit on each inter-broker bridge connector. |
| `broker_bridge_decrease_consumer_priority` | boolean | `true` | Decrease a bridged consumer's priority by hop count so ActiveMQ's demand-forwarding prefers the fewest-broker-hop (direct) path. This gives [cost-aware routing](../architecture/dynamic-routing.md) a stable baseline to deliberately override when the direct link is the slow one. |
| `broker_tls_ready_probe` | boolean | `true` | Probe the broker TLS listener for readiness before proceeding through the boot state machine. |

Adaptive tuning of socket buffers, read-chunk sizes, and per-link bridge connection counts
based on live link metrics (RTT, send-latency, backlog, BDP). **Auto-tuning is off by

## Coordinator decentralization (region-first, multi-global)

Decompose the single static global into a region-first mesh with elected/sharded coordinators. All flags
default to the prior single-static-global behaviour; see the
[Coordinator Decentralization plan](../design/coordinator-decentralization-plan.md).

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `global_optional` | boolean | `false` | Region-first autonomy: a region comes up and peers with **no global present**, starting its discovery engine + peer maintenance immediately and bounding the global-join instead of blocking. |

| `coordinator_expected` | int | `0` | Stable coordinator-cluster size for quorum (2f+1). `0` = infer from the high-water mark. Set it to the intended count so a lone survivor cannot self-commit. |
| `coordinator_election_policy` | String | `identity` | Leader policy: `identity` (lowest coordinator path) or `centroid` (k-center: most central over the learned latency graph). |
| `coordinator_lease_sec` | int | `15` | Coordinator heartbeat/lease window; a coordinator silent this long drops from the live set. |
| `security_peer_federation` | boolean | `false` | Two independently-rooted regions cross-trust as **equals** (bilateral CA exchange, identity preserved) instead of one being subordinated under a common issuer — removes the need for a global as trust broker. |

---

## Data plane

The high-throughput event data plane and its sharding/journaling. Sharding splits data-plane
traffic across N topics for parallel inter-broker transfer.

| `dataplane_shard_topic` | String | `global.event` | Base topic name for shards (e.g. `global.event.0..N-1`). |
| `dataplane_parallel_connections` | boolean | **computed** (`shards > 1`) | Use a dedicated broker connection per shard instead of multiplexing all shards over one session. Default is `true` when `dataplane_shards > 1`, else `false`. |
| `dataplane_io_buffer_bytes` | int | `64 KB` | I/O buffer size for data-plane message handling (wsapi data-plane path). |

## Database (controller state store)

The embedded controller DB (Derby by default). `db_username`/`db_password` have **no
default** (unset = no credentials, appropriate for the embedded Derby driver).

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `db_name` | String | `cresco-controller-db` | Logical database name. |
| `db_driver` | String | `org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver` | JDBC driver class (HSQLDB alternative is present but commented out). |
| `db_jdbc` | String | **computed** | JDBC URL. Computed default = `jdbc:derby:<dbPath>;create=true` from the resolved DB path. |
| `db_username` | String | *unset* | DB username. **Unset = none** (embedded Derby needs no credentials). |
| `db_password` | String | *unset* | DB password. **Unset = none.** |

## Repository & data paths

Where the node stores its data, plugin cache, and jar repository.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cresco_data_location` | String | `cresco-data` | Root directory for this node's persistent data (DB, keys, journals). |
| `agent_data_directory` | String | **computed** | Agent data directory; default derives from `cresco_data_location` / the default filesystem working directory. |
| `tmp_data` | String | *unset* | Override for the host temporary-data directory (host application). |
| `repo_dir` | String | `repo` | Directory served by the **repo** plugin as the jar/plugin repository root. |
| `repo_cache_dir` | String | `cresco-data/agent-repo-cache` | Local cache directory for plugins the agent downloads from a repo. |

---

## wsapi (WebSocket API gateway)

Settings for the wsapi plugin: listener port, TLS material, socket tuning, and the service
key that authenticates HTTP-upgrade requests.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `wsapi_port` | String (int) | `8282`¹ | Port the wsapi WebSocket server binds. ¹Read as a string; supply as plain text. |
| `wsapi_keystore_password` | String | *unset* | Password for the wsapi TLS keystore. **Unset = generated self-signed default.** |
| `wsapi_ssl_provider` | String | `JDK` | TLS engine: `JDK` (standard Java SSL) or `OPENSSL` (native/BoringSSL). |
| `cresco_service_key` | String | *unset* | API key/token required on the WebSocket HTTP-upgrade handshake. **Unset = no key required.** |
| `wsapi_read_chunk_bytes` | int | `256 KB` | Max bytes per socket read (larger reduces syscalls on bulk streams). |
| `wsapi_socket_buffer_bytes` | int | `4 MB` | TCP socket send/receive buffer size for wsapi connections. |
| `wsapi_write_high_water_bytes` | int | `2 MB` | Outbound-buffer high-water mark that triggers backpressure. |

---

## stunnel (secure TCP tunneling)

Socket-tuning knobs for the stunnel plugin's tunnel sockets.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `stunnel_read_chunk_bytes` | int | `256 KB` | Max bytes per socket read on tunnel sockets. |
| `stunnel_socket_buffer_bytes` | int | `4 MB` | TCP socket send/receive buffer size for tunnel sockets. |
| `stunnel_write_high_water_bytes` | int | `2 MB` | Outbound-buffer high-water mark that triggers backpressure on a tunnel. |

## Notes on defaults

- **`min`/`max`/`base` tuning triples** (`net_socket_buffer_*`, `net_read_chunk_*`,
  `net_connections_*`) only diverge when `net_autotune=true`. With auto-tuning off, the base
  value (`net_socket_buffer_bytes`, `net_read_chunk_bytes`, `net_connections_per_link`) is used
  as-is and the min/max bounds are inert.
- **Computed defaults** (`broker_memory_limit`, `db_jdbc`, `journal_dir`, `dp-journal_dir`,
  `agent_data_directory`, `dataplane_parallel_connections`) are derived from the JVM heap, the
  resolved data location, or another parameter — set them explicitly only to override the
  derivation.
- **Dual-default parameters** (`discovery_ipv4_agent_timeout`, `discovery_ipv6_agent_timeout`,
  `period_multiplier`, `enable_repo`, `enable_wsapi`) are read in more than one place with
  differing shipped defaults; the effective value depends on which subsystem reads it first.
  Set them explicitly if the exact value matters to you.
